## Iris Flower Classification Project

### Project Description

This project uses the Iris dataset to develop a machine learning model that classifies Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The workflow includes data exploration, preprocessing, visualization, and model training using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The project also features a user interaction component for predicting species based on input measurements.

**Key steps:**
1. Import and explore data.
2. Preprocess and encode data.
3. Visualize data relationships.
4. Split data into training and testing sets.
5. Train and evaluate an SVM model.
6. Allow user predictions based on flower measurements.
